# Section 7: IP Addressing

42. IP Addressing (OBJ. 1.4)
    - all addresses must uniquely identify a specific object
43. IPv4 Addressing (OBJ. 1.4)
    - 5 classes / 1st octet / default subnet mask / possible host number
      - A / 1 - 127 / 255.0.0.0 / 16.7M
      - B / 128 - 191 / 255.255.0.0 / 65,535
      - C / 192 - 233 / 255.255.255.0 / 256
      - D / 244 - 239 / no subnet mask - special usage
        - multicast routing
      - E / 240 - 255 / no default subnet mask / 268 million / reserved
        - experimental purposes
        - research
        - development
    - classful mask
      - the default subnet mask for a given class of IP addresses
    - subnetting
    - CIDR - classless inter-domain routing
      - allows for the borrowing some of those host bits and reassigning them to the network portion
      - CIDR notation -> IP/subnetMask
      - shorthand notation used to summarize continuous networks called using route aggregation
    - RFC 1918
      - used to documetn how organizations could conduct address allocation for private internets / intranet
      - class A
        - starts with 10 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
        - up to 16.7M possible hosts
      - class B
        - starts with 172.16 - 172.31
        - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
        - up to 1.05M hosts
      - class C
        - 192.168
        - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
        - up to 65,535 hosts
    - special addresses
      - loopback
        - 127.0.0.1
        - localhost
      - APIPA
        - automatic private IP addresses
        - used when a device does not have a static IP address or cannot reach a DHCP server
        - 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255
    - DORA Process
      - Discover
      - Offer
      - Request
      - Acknowledge
    - Virtual IP Addresses
      - an IP address that does not correlate to an actual phusical network interface
      - usage
        - NAT
        - fault tolerance
        - virtualization
44. IPv4 Data Flows (OBJ. 1.4)
    - Unicast
    - Multicast
      - from a specific source to multiple, yet specified destinations
    - Broadcast
      - from a single source, to anyone, no limitations whom to
45. Assigning IP Addresses (OBJ. 1.4 & 1.6)
    1. static
    2. dynamic -> DHCP
       - IP address
       - subnet mask
       - default gateway
       - DNS/WINS server address
         - Windows Internet Names Service - WINS
         - identifies NetBIOS systems on a TCP/IP network and converts those NetBIOS names to IP addresses
         - it works only in MS Windows domain
    3. dynamic IP allocation protocols
       - BOOTP
         - the oldest
         - the least used nowadays
         - allows a workstation to load a copy of their boot image over the network
         - static MAC + IP table at server
       - DHCP
         - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
         - assign IP based on an assignable scope or pool of addresses
         - provides the ability to configure numerous other options within it
         - each IP address is leased for a period of time and returns to the pool when lease expires
         - modern implementation of BOOTP
         - most commonly used nowadays
       - APIPA
         - when a device doesn't have a static IP address or cannot connect to DHCP server
         - by default activated as an alternative configuration on windows machines
         - allows for quick configuration of a LAN without the need for a DHCP server
         - APIPA-assigned devices cannot communicate outside the LAN or with non-APIPA devices
       - ZeroConf
         - upgradeed APIPA version
         - assign an IPv4 link-local address to a client
         - resolving local computer addresses using mDNS
         - perform service discovery on a network
         - Bonjour @ Apple, LLMNR @ Windows, systemD @ Linux
46. Computer Mathematics (OBJ. 1.4)
47. Subnetting (OBJ. 1.4)
    - Network ID
      - first IP address of a network
    - Broadcast ID
      - last address of a network
    - VLSM
      - Variable length subnet masks
      - subnetting of subnets
      - allows subnets of various sizes to be used and requires a routing protocol that supports it
    - routing protocols
      - RIP
      - OSPF
      - IS-IS
      - EIGRP
      - BGP
48. Subnetting Practice (OBJ. 1.4)
49. Subnetting by Hand (OBJ. 1.4)
50. IPv6 Addressing (OBJ. 1.4)
    - larger address space
    - no broadcasting
    - no fragmentation
    - no MTU for discovery in each section
    - can coexist with IPv4
    - tunneling
      - allows an existing IPv4 router to carry IPv6 traffic
    - simplified header
    - globally-routed
      - similar to unicast class A, B, C
      - starts with 2000 - 3999
    - link-local / local use
      - used like a private IP in IPv4
      - only in local area netowrk
      - begins with FE80
    - SLAAC
      - stateless address autoconfiguration
      - eliminates the need to obtain addresses or other configuration information from a central server
    - multicast addresses
      - used to identify a set of interfaces and begins with FF
    - anycast address
      - used to identify a set of interfaces so thtat a packet can be sent to any member of a set
    - EUI
      - Extended Unique Identifier
      - allows a host to assign itself a unique 64-bit IPv4 interface identifier called an EUI-64
      - in-between 48-bit MAC address, there are added 16-bit hex data
    - NDP
      - Neighbor Discovery Protocol
      - used to learn the layer 2 addresses that are on a given network
      - router solicitation
      - router advertisement
      - neighbor solicitation
      - neighbor advertisement
      - redirection
51. IPv6 Data Flows (OBJ. 1.4)
    - unicast
      - peer to peer
    - multicast
      - peer to multicast group
    - anycast
      - no more broadcast in IP v6
      - unique to IPv6
      - data travels from a single source device to the device nearest to multiple (but specific) destination devices
